1. Introduction looks good.
2. In the breakdown section, you have a bit TOO much detail.  
   You only need to specify the CSU-levels not the individual components like buttons.
   For example, you can get rid of 5.2.1.1.1, and both 5.2.1.1.2's
   For example, under 5.2.1.2, you only need the next level down, e.g., 5.2.1.2.1
3. Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.3, you can have all the "shall" statements at one level
   You don't really need to break them down any further, since they all belong to the same level
   If you actually identify sub-sections in a CSU, *THEN* you can break it down further
4. Remember that "will" and "should" statements go on *separate lines* with no numbering

Nice job on this, you could perhaps use a little more detail on such things as:
   what errors will be checked by the front end
   what displayed buttons there are
   what each button will do operationally
Watch out for "weasel words" like
