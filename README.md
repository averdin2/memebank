 ### Contributing to Memebank

 #### Getting Started
 1. Clone and install node modules
 ```
  git clone https://github.com/aherco/memebank.git
  npm install
 ```

 2. Run the dev server
 ```
  npm start
 ```
 Any changes made will update in real time on the local node server.



 #### Adding a Feature
 1. Make a branch with the title of your feature.
      - The convention is lowercase with words separated by a "-".
 2. Work till the feature is fully functional.
 3. Submit a pull request for code review before merging it with master.
      - This way only finished features make it to the master branch.


 #### Commit Convention
   - "Don't commit non-working code" - BJ
   - Commit message begins with a capital letter
   - Describe what was done in clear terms (No commit messages like "Small fixes" or "Worked on/Updated *****.txt")
       - Should be able to tell what you worked on by the content of the message
   - Each commit should have a significant change >> No "one-line" change commits
       - That means try not to make a commit unless you're absolutely sure that you're done with your part
        so we can cut down on these.
   - MOST COMMITS SHOULD FOLLOW THIS CONVENTION
