Hi, MemeBank team ----

Very nice work on this Preliminary SDD!

Figure 1 is quite nice, and figure 2 shows the top-level use cases well.

A couple of nit-picky things I noticed:
1) Make sure you refer to your project in a uniform way.  Sometimes you say
   "meme bank", sometimes "Meme bank", sometimes "memebank", and so on.
2) In the introduction, you might include a sentence that defines exactly
   what a "meme" is, specifically in the context of your project.  This would
   be something good to include in presentations, as well.
3) Be sure to check your grammar throughout; for example, in section 6.1.1
   you have "...easier to find ones memes and be...." which should be
   "...easier to find one's memes and be..."
4) Section 6.2.2 is supposed to reflect interactions between the *software*
   components of the system.  For example, you have the login page being
   displayed to the user, but you should focus on HOW the login page will
   *interact with the system components to which it is connected [like the
   user table in the database?]
5) The ERD looks great!

Great job overall -- you guys put a lot of work into this, and it shows!

Fix these items in the next release for full credit on the document.

You have 10% out of 10% which is an A-plus.

Regards,
Prof. Johnson
