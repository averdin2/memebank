# Status Report 11-01-2017

## What we did this week

- Complete Database schema for the Backend
- Created API endpoints
- Continued further development of front end. Applying fixes and updates


## What we plan to do next week

- We plan on hosting the backend
- We plan on connecting the front end to the backend such that:
  - Users who register are registered into the database
  - Newly added images will show up in the database
  - Deleted images are deleted from the database
  - And more
- Implement Redux (see problem 3)
- Implement video links
- Implement card deletion


## Problems

- The two stack grid problems from last week still persist.
- State management design
  - The way we currently handle state management makes it hard to make changes without looking in multiple components
  - Therefore we will try to implement Redux
  - Advantages:
    - One store that describes state of whole app
    - We don’t have to look in multiple places to add/change functionality
    - It's easier to maintain
    - States that are changed through functions return a copy of the old state with changes
    - Altering state is done through pure functions which means that there should be no side effects (also it doesn't look like spaghetti unlike our current state management)
  - Disadvantages:
    - It’s hard to learn and implement
    - We have to restructure our frontend
