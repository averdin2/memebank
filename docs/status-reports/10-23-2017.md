# Status Report 10-23-2017

## What we did this week

- Completed the Software Design Description document
- Completed memebank alpha deliverable which includes:
  - A working front end
  - Login/join page
  - Personal bank page
  - Link input component with an 'enter' buttons
  - Note: We do not have a backend completed yet, so the completed alpha had a template set of hardcoded images to show functionality
- Marked the beginning of building memebank's RESTful API
- Started building the backend using Ruby

## What we plan to do next week

- Continue building the API (more controllers) and the backend.
- Fix any problems that we have for now (elaborated in the next section)

## Problems

- The front end is built with a Reactjs component named React Stack Grid. Adding a new image would sometimes create whitespace in between the new image and the old one, which makes the overall page look unaesthetic. 
- There is what we would like to dub the 'refresh bug', which when refreshing the main bank page, would have all the images in it pile on top of each other. Also another stack grid problem.
